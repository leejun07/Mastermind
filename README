MVP:

- Persist history across one game session
- Enable user to start the game by pressing start
- Once they press start, call the random number generator and get the random 4 character number and store it to check against
- Enable user to submit 4 numbers (Upon each guess decrement from number ten)

  - Check submitted number against store number
  - If correct say winner
  - If incorrect and ten has not been decremented fully allow them to submit another number
  - If incorrect and ten has become zero say loser and end the game

File Structure:

- Server
  - index.ts // initialize everything here
  - app.ts // where you should define routers
  - middleware
  - routes
    - post request /start
      - validate the start request
      - call random number generator
      - create a cache (object or array) where user input will be store
    - post request /submit
      - validate current guess
  - controllers
  - services
  - types
